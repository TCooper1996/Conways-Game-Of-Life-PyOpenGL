# Conways-Game-Of-Life-PyOpenGL
This is a very simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Python, QT5 and OpenGL
The user can click on tiles individually or drag the mouse over tiles while holding the left mouse button to activate cells.
Right clicking and dragging removes cells. Clicking the play button at the bottom starts the simulation. Pressing the button again pauses the simulation. There are two sliders at the bottom, the top of which controls the speed at which generation progress, wheras the bottom adjusts the zoom. 
PyOpenGL is the OpenGL binding, and PyQt5 is the QT binding.
